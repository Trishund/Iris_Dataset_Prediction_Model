# Iris Flower Classification â€“ Interactive Web App (HTML + JavaScript)

This is a lightweight, interactive web application for classifying Iris flowers using basic machine learning algorithms, implemented entirely in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app demonstrates client-side machine learning and visualization, with no server or backend required.

## Project Overview

The application uses the classic **Iris dataset**, which contains measurements of sepal and petal dimensions for three species of Iris flowers:

* Setosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica

The app allows users to explore the dataset, visualize feature relationships, and perform real-time predictions using simple models built in JavaScript.

## Features

* **Data Overview**
  View the sample dataset and see how data points are distributed across species.

* **Visualizations**
  Interactive scatter plots and box plots help you understand relationships between sepal and petal dimensions.

* **Machine Learning Models**

  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Decision Tree
  * Naive Bayes
    All models are implemented in JavaScript and run directly in the browser.

* **Custom Predictions**
  Enter your own sepal/petal measurements and get instant species predictions from all three models.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open the file `iris_flower_classification.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Explore the dataset, switch between models, and try custom inputs for prediction.

> No installation or server setup is required.

## Purpose and Learning Goals

This project was built as part of a larger machine learning series during a Data Science internship at **CodSoft**. The primary goal was to go beyond notebooks and explore:

* How classic ML models can be implemented in a browser environment
* How to visualize and interact with data in real time
* How to learn and experiment through hands-on coding

The code is intentionally minimal, focused on clarity and interactivity. While not production-ready, it offers an educational experience and creative experimentation.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Vanilla)
* Chart.js (for visualizations)

## Acknowledgments

This project is one of several created to explore machine learning concepts and user experience design. It was developed independently, with guidance from public tutorials, educational resources, and AI-assisted development tools for faster prototyping and idea testing.
